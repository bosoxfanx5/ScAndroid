# ScAndroid

My very first mobile application. This project was for a Software Design and Development class (CS 246). We were assigned
to create a real world application for a real sponsor. My partner had a sponsor in need of a mobile application. We were not 
only to design and develop this application, but to interact with our sponsor on a weekly basis to provide updates and ask any
questions relating to the look and functionality of the app.

This application was developed in Java for Android using Android Studio using various design patterns. The application is a 
barcode scanning application. The app scans a variety of barcode symbologies 
(EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E, Code-39, Code-93, Code-128, ITF, Codabar) using Google's Vision API. The data received from 
the scan is sent to a remote server on the same network as the device scanning the barcode using a pre-developed listening 
service over XMLRPC. The user is permitted to indicate the IP address of the server where the scanned data is to be sent.
